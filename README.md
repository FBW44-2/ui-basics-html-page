# Intro to HTML

## Markup

> In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text.

## Editor

The editor is where we are going to spend most of our time.
It might be a good idea to get to know your editor well. Ger familiar with various shortcuts - you dont need to learn them all at once, but try to add a shortcut to your mind every now and then.

To open the command pallet in visual code:

```
CMD + Shift + P (mac)
CTTL + Shift + P (linux)
```

Once you are there you can search for the command you are looking for.

For example if you are in a markdown file, you can open the Markdown Preview and see the md file rendered.

You can also get to the UI Settings of VS Code.
